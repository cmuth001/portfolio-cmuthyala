                    I currently work with Chandrasekhar (Chandu) on the same team at Highmark Health. It has been my
                    pleasure to work along side him on multiple projects. With every project or task that Chandu has
                    been assigned, he makes it his personal business to master the technologies involved. This is
                    particularly noteworthy as our team requires true, full-stack, expertise. Chandu has successfully
                    completed work in a variety of platforms and languages ranging from nodejs and google cloud, to sql
                    and java.
                    Chandu is extremely hard working, and learns very quickly. He would be a tremendous addition to any
                    software development team.

                    Chandrasekhar is focused, calm and committed and is a great addition to any team. He worked with me
                    on a collaboration project for the Center of Learning and Teaching in Old Dominion University. He
                    quickly established himself as an invaluable member and came up with several fresh ideas at the
                    meetings that we successfully implemented. A confident and friendly co-worker, Chandrasekhar is
                    popular with his colleagues and stakeholders alike and has a real passion and enthusiasm for the
                    software industry.

                I coached a student hackathon, where Chandra and his teammates did an outstanding job working
                together and ultimately placing in the competition. Chandra was focused and adaptable during this
                high stress time, and was a pleasure to work with! I would highly recommend Chandra in any position,
                because he worked so well within a team, and was always open to suggestion for the project!

                I had the pleasure of serving as Chandra's coach during the 2018 Dominion Enterprises Hackathon.
                Through out the Hackathon, Chandra stayed focused and collaborated with his team to deliver a great
                product. I was particularly impressed Chandra's ability remain calm while being under such a short
                turn around time for his project. With his assistance his team took home the third place prize. I
                would highly recommend Chandra and would welcome the opportunity to work with him again in the
                future.
